# Linux-Zero-to-Hero
Linux Learning Series for DevOps, SRE, System, and Cloud Engineers.

- **What is Linux?**
  - Linux is a free, open-source operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
  - It's the core of many popular operating systems (called “distributions”), such as Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora.
  - Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, which make it the backbone of most servers and cloud infrastructure worldwide.
  - It powers everything from web servers and cloud platforms to mobile devices and supercomputers.
 
- **Why Learn Linux?**
  - Linux powers most servers, cloud platforms, and DevOps tools worldwide.
  - Essential for automation, scripting, troubleshooting, and system administration.
  - In-demand skill for top tech jobs (DevOps, SRE, Cloud, System Engineer, etc.).
 
- **How is Linux more secure than Windows?**
  - Linux is generally considered more secure than Windows because of its
    - Open-source nature
      - Anyone can inspect, audit, and improve the code. The collective effort allows vulnerability to be found and fixed faster compared to Windows.
    - Strict user permissions
      - Linux used robust multi-user models. 
    - Controlled software installation
      - Linux employs centralized repositories verified by distribution maintainers.
    - Kernel-level security frameworks
      - Security frameworks such as SELinux, AppArmor, and secomp that enforce mandatory access controls and system call filtering.
      - These frameworks limit the action of processes even if compromised.
    - Smaller attack surface
      - The diversity of distribution and smaller desktop market share make it a less attractive target for malware developers.
